Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment [Chorus 1] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright  [Chorus 2] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment [Chorus 1] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright  [Chorus 2] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Uh My voice is gone already, shit Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy  [Verse 9] Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies"" Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?"" So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh Like, oh well, I can say that I tried Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.‚Äã I'm screamin', ""Hi"" to the sky up with a smile on my face Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab That's the type of shit that makes you think back To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah) Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me"" Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me? To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's This is a natural high I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt But I guess I am not full enough, damn I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave So when I wake up in the morning with something to see Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be  [Verse 10] Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous- Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better That's benefit of the doubt I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like- Yeah, this is freedom of speech Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like- Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity Apparently, it all has to do with popularity There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to What is carefully being prepared to me Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least  [Verse 11] Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy 'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in  [Verse 12] -Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin' With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin' Limited ability with little humility But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out Into reality, in normality actually happily Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why? 'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet But my time is limited, and I better figure this Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips And let me just tell you what I have came to do Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through And if a major record label is looking at me I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats I can rap fast, and rap slow I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so I'm like MJ back when he had the afro Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not But before everyone gets angry, stop I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block All the people who keep on going crazy off 'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker With some dominant teachers I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid So when you're nearin' this, please let me know When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go Hear the metronome combined in the compilation To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation But that is just a dream, and probably a combination Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name But when you think about it, it is all insane What can be created from chemicals in this brain But when you look at me, you lackin' respect When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame You think about how people used to sit and call you names And you check and wonder if it will be all the same Step back into reality, it all remains, damn  [Interlude 3] Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit Hold on, uh Goddamn it  [Verse 13] My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever But I am very clever, okay, okay I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too These are some shit' that you can drink to But drink water unless you're of age You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy  [Interlude 4] Okay, okay Uh Uh Ayy  [Verse 14] I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous -Most of humanity's made of idiots I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand? You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand? Please... what I do is barely poetry There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me But still consider me confident Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin' It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape To get away from how we're living life day-to-day Some people find it in a drink or in a cup Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love But all I know is that it's tough And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much  [Verse 15] I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper? These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life -Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night -Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass -Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day 'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
