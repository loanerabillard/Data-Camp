Straighten up, little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you cryin' about? You got me  [Verse 1] Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein' Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream You might also like[Chorus 1] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright  [Verse 2] Heh, it's funny I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying 'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV And Mama didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin' Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment [Chorus 1] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright  [Chorus 2] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office 'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on You might also like[Chorus] White America!

To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's This is a natural high I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt But I guess I am not full enough, damn I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave So when I wake up in the morning with something to see Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be  [Verse 10] Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous- Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better That's benefit of the doubt I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like- Yeah, this is freedom of speech Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like- Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity Apparently, it all has to do with popularity There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to What is carefully being prepared to me Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least  [Verse 11] Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy 'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in  [Verse 12] -Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin' With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin' Limited ability with little humility But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out Into reality, in normality actually happily Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why? 'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet But my time is limited, and I better figure this Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips And let me just tell you what I have came to do Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through And if a major record label is looking at me I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats I can rap fast, and rap slow I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so I'm like MJ back when he had the afro Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not But before everyone gets angry, stop I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block All the people who keep on going crazy off 'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker With some dominant teachers I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid So when you're nearin' this, please let me know When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go Hear the metronome combined in the compilation To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation But that is just a dream, and probably a combination Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name But when you think about it, it is all insane What can be created from chemicals in this brain But when you look at me, you lackin' respect When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame You think about how people used to sit and call you names And you check and wonder if it will be all the same Step back into reality, it all remains, damn  [Interlude 3] Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit Hold on, uh Goddamn it  [Verse 13] My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever But I am very clever, okay, okay I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too These are some shit' that you can drink to But drink water unless you're of age You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy  [Interlude 4] Okay, okay Uh Uh Ayy  [Verse 14] I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous -Most of humanity's made of idiots I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand? You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand? Please... what I do is barely poetry There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me But still consider me confident Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin' It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape To get away from how we're living life day-to-day Some people find it in a drink or in a cup Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love But all I know is that it's tough And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much  [Verse 15] I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper? These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life -Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night -Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass -Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day 'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
